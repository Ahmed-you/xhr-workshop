In this workshop we will build gifs search by

- DOM manipulation.

## Getting started

1. Clone this repo and open in your text editor.

2. Open index.html in your browser. You'll find a template there. Your job is to fill it with data using the Giphy API.

## Giphy API

[Giphy](http://api.giphy.com/) is an animated GIF search engine.

You can find the API Documentation [here](https://github.com/Giphy/GiphyAPI).
